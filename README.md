## About me

### I am a Post-Doctoral Scholar of the AI-EDGE Institute and Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA. I received my Ph.D. degree from Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, USA, in 2022.

### Research Interests:
#### Online learning, reinforcement learning and bandit learning, with applications in Edge AI and 6G+ networks.
#### Online convex optimization, with applications in networking, cloud computing and smart grid.
#### Regret analysis and competitive analysis for online algorithms.
